# Test Generation Guidelines

- Put tests in the `test` folder close to the related logic.
- Don't add `console.log` statements in the final code.
- Use this pattern for test descriptions: `When...., then...`.
- Use `vitest`
- Some helper functions are in the [/src/utils/test.ts](/src/utils/test.ts) file. Use them.
