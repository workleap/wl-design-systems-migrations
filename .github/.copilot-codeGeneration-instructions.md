# Code Generation Rules

- Avoid using `any` type in TypeScript.
- Keep functions small and focused. Avoid lengthy functions.
- Keep files small and focused only if possible and make sense.
- This project doesn't have any `build` script.
  - To test a codemod for a file, you can use the approaches in the `/scripts` folder.
- For details of the project and architecture, use [README](//README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md) files.

## Technologies

- Use `pnpm` not `npm`
- Use `pnpx` not `npx`
- Testing -> `vitest`
