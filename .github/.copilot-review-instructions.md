# PR Review Guidelines

## Tests

- Test descriptions are clear and follow other tests' style.
- The tests are comprehensive and cover all edge cases.
- The documentation is updated if there are any changes in functionality.
- The `input.tsx` and related `output.txt` are tests for mappings rules, not the main logic.

## Code structure

- The core logic is in the `src/migrations` folder.
- Mapping rules are in the `src/mappings` folder.

## Code quality

- If the changes are related to logic, make sure they are comprehensive and they cover different coding styles.
